/**
 * Set Buffer Address (SBA) Order
 *
 * @see IBM SA21-9247-6 - IBM 5250 Information Display System Functions Reference Manual
 *
 * Format:
 *
 * SBA Order   Bytes 1 and 2           Bytes 3 to ?
 *
 *       X'11'    Row Address   Column Address   Repeated Character
 *
 * Function:
 *  - Read: Used as a delimiter between fields that are sent back to the host system in response to
 *    the Read MDT command. See the index entry read MDT fields command.
 *  - Write: Used to set the current display address and thereby determine where the data display or
 *    field definition begins. Two bytes that follow this order tell the 5251 Models 2 or 12 this
 *    information.
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * A parameter error is posted when:
 * - There are fewer than 2 bytes following the order.
 * - The row address is equal to 0 or greater than 12 for Model 2 (960 characters) or 24 for Model
 *    12 (1920 characters).
 * - The column size is equal to 0 or greater than 80.
 *
 * Default: When the SBA is not specified in the Write to Display, the data starts at row 1, column 1
 * because this is where the Write to Display command initializes it. See the index entry write to
 * display command.
 *
 * Format:
 *
 * SBA Order   Bytes 1 and 2           Bytes 3 to ?
 *
 *       X'11'    Row Address   Column Address   Repeated Character
