/**
 * Start Of Header (SOH) Order
 *
 * @see IBM SA21-9247-6 - IBM 5250 Information Display System Functions Reference Manual
 *
 * Function: This order specifies the header information that goes into the format table.
 * See the index entry format table.
 * It also selects the resequencing function when data is read from the display.
 * See the index entry field control word.
 *
 * Restrictions: A parameter error is posted when the output data stream ends before the
 * number of bytes needed have been sent or when the first byte of the order is not between 1 and 254
 *
 * Format:
 * Order      Length      Variable Bytes
 * Hex 01     (Note 1.)   (Note 2.)
 *
 * Note 1:
 * The length byte determines the number of header bytes following the length byte, but this number
 * does not include the length byte. It must be greater than 0 and less than 255.
 *
 * Note 2:
 * This chart shows what the bytes following the length byte can contain:
 * Byte Description
 * 1    Reserved
 * 2    Format ID - from hex 00 to hex FF
 * 3    Hex 00 = no resequencing (all resequencing field control words are ignored).
 *      Hex xx = resequence per field control words in format table. See the index entry field
 *      control word. (For example, xx = 01 = field 1). Byte 3 also points to the first field
 *      to be returned when the Read Input Fields/Read MDT command is serviced.
 * 4    Row address of the operator error line. If this is unspecified or out of range, the error
 *      line defaults to the last line of the display, or to the message line, if supported.
 * 5-7  The following chart shows the data- included switches for the command function keys.
