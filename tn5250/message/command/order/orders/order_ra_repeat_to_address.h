/**
 * Repeat to Address (RA) Order
 *
 * @see IBM SA21-9247-6 - IBM 5250 Information Display System Functions Reference Manual
 *
 * Format:
 *
 * RA Order   Bytes 1 and 2           Bytes 3 to ?
 *
 *       X'02'    Row Address   Column Address   Repeated Character
 *
 * This order displays a character in every position starting from the current display address and
 * going to the last position specified by this order. If these two addresses match, 1 character is
 * displayed.
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * A parameter error is posted when:
 * - there are fewer than 3 bytes after the order;
 * - there is a row address value either equal to 0 or greater than 12 for Model 2 (960 characters) or 24 for Model 12 (1920 characters); or
 * - there is a column address value greater than 80 or equal to O.
 * The order is also rejected if the specified ending address is less than the current display address.
 *
 * Note: Although any character can be repeated, avoid
 * using hex 11 (SBA), because this value is used as the delimiter between the fields sent in response to the Read MDT command.
 *
 * Results: The character is repeated from the current
 * display address through the ending display address specified. The current display address is then
 * updated to the value of the last position + 1.
