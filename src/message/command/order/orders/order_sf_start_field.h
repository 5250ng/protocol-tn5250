/**
 * Start Field (SF) Order
 *
 * @see IBM SA21-9247-6 - IBM 5250 Information Display System Functions Reference Manual
 *
 * Function: This order defines input and output fields.
 * If an input field is being defined, it also resets any
 * pending aid byte and locks the keyboard.
 *
 * Note: Although this order can be used for output
 * fields, it is not recommended because it degrades
 * performance. Use the SBA order instead.
 *
 * Restrictions: A parameter error is posted when:
 *  - The output data stream ends before the given number of bytes have been sent.
 *  - The field length is equal to 0, if the field is not signed numeric.
 *    If the field is signed numeric, either a 0 or a 1 causes an error.
 *    Note: The length byte is ignored when an entry is modified in the format table.
 *  - The address for the end of the field exceeds the end of the display.
 *  - The input field addresses are not in ascending order. For input fields defined
 *    by previous Write to Display commands, the input field address must be equal to
 *    the starting address of an already specified field or greater than the last
 *    field already defined.
 *  - Too many input fields are defined for the display.
 *  - Invalid screen attribute is specified.
 *  - The defined input field overlays a previously defined field.
 *
